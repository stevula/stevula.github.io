          My first exposure to HTML was in a high school web design class around 2002. We didn't use any of this fancy-schmancy CSS magic! All of our styling was in the HTML and we positioned everything by putting it inside a giant table with invisible borders. And we called that giant table a webpage. You may already be acquainted with this style of web design from the Berkshire Hathaway website (glorious!).
        </p>
        <p>
          I took another jab at a web design class while attending university in 2011. I'm not gonna lie to you, but CSS blew my mind a bit. Everyone was really into divs back then. Divs inside of divs, inside of other divs! It was like div-ception.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here I am, four years later and once again, everything has changed! They took the role of the old divs and split it up into all these other semantic tags, like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;main&gt;... which I tend to think of simply as more specific kinds of divs. Naturally, being the borderline perfectionist that I am, I had to figure out the best and proper way of using each of these new tags. "What are the best practices?" I asked. Well, let me tell you, there is quite the free-for-all going on right now in the world of CSS, it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people advocate doing away with id selectors (except as JS hooks). Proponents of Atomic advocate using only one declaration per CSS block - the result of which is a strange hybrid of the inline HTML styling of the past and the website-wide mutability that CSS brings. And then there's BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS... the list goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the prompt for this blog post was supposed to be: <em>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids?</em> Traditionally, a <strong>class</strong> is used for a bunch of things that you want to style the same and an <strong>id</strong> for something that is styled uniquely. It used to be that simple, at least.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now some people say you should never use an <strong>id</strong>, because maybe you will want to style other things like it later. Why not use a <strong>class</strong> instead; even if it only applies to one thing right now, you never know if you might want to use that styling on other elements later. And let's not forget that <strong>id</strong>'s add complexity to the specificity structure of the CSS. And yet, others would argue that <strong>id</strong>'s fulfill a purpose and we should use them for that!
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, I'm not sure that was what the writers of this prompt at had in mind, but I found the debate interesting. I think I'll refrain from picking a side for the time being. The most important thing, I think, is to do things consistently within the context of the project.
