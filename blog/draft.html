	Today is brought to you by the word <code>Enumerable</code>. Specifically, I'm going to talk about the <code>#zip</code> method.
</p>
<p>
	Ruby's documentation has this to say on <code>#zip</code>:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Takes one element from enum and merges corresponding elements from each args. This generates a sequence of n-element arrays, where n is one more than the count of arguments. The length of the resulting sequence will be enum#size. If the size of any argument is less than enum#size, nil values are supplied. If a block is given, it is invoked for each output array, otherwise an array of arrays is returned.

<p>
	So there you have it. Need I say more?
</p>
<p>
	"But I have no idea what that means!" you say? Ok, fine, if you insist on talking in English... it basically works like this:
</p>
<p>	
	You can call <code>#zip</code> on an array and pass it another array as an argument, like so:
</p>
<code class="code-block">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
<code class="code-block">letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]</code>
<code class="code-block">numbers.zip(letters)</code>
<p>	
	Then it "zips" the arrays together, by taking the element at index 0 of each, and putting them both into a new two-element array:
</p>
<code class="code-block">[1, "a"]</code>
<p>
	It does the same for each index, making a bunch of two-element arrays: 
</p>
<code class="code-block">[1, "a"]</code>
<code class="code-block">[2, "b"]</code>
<code class="code-block">[3, "c"]</code>
<code class="code-block">[4, "d"]</code>
<p>
	Then it bundles up all of those mini-arrays into a new array to hold them all:
</p>
<code class="code-block">numbers.zip(letters) => [[1, "a"], [2, "b"], [3, "c"], [4, "d"]]</code>
<p>	
	I should clarify that the method just returns this end result, not all the intermediate steps. Those were just to demonstrate what it's doing under the hood.
</p>
<p>	
	But what if the arrays aren't of equal length? <code>#zip</code> will still work, but it will zip the existent value with a <code>nil</code>. That makes sense to me, since if you try to access index 10 in a 5-element array, it returns <code>nil</code> too. Still, it's something to watch out for when using <code>#zip</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Interestingly, you can also pass multiple arguments to <code>#zip</code> and it will zip them all together:
</p>
<code class="code-block">integers = [1, 2, 3]</code>
<code class="code-block">letters = ["a", "b", "c"]</code>
<code class="code-block">floats = [1.3, 3.7]</code>
<code class="code-block">integers.zip(letters, floats)</code>
<code class="code-block">=> [[1, "a", 1.3], [2, "b", 3.7], [3, "b", nil]]</code>
<p>	
	So, what is <code>#zip</code> useful for? It's an easy way to combine connected data that's split between multiple arrays when the same indexes are related to each other:
</p>
<code class="code-block">employees = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"]</code>
<code class="code-block">salaries = [50000, 48000, 80000]</code>
<code class="code-block">locations = ["San Francisco", "Chicago", "New York"]</code>
<code class="code-block">employees.zip(salaries, locations)</code>
<code class="code-block">=> [["Alice", 50000, "San Francisco"], ["Bob", 48000, "Chicago"], ["Eve", 80000, "New York"]]</code>
<p>
	It keeps those related elements together in the new array. You can change the order of the items very easily by changing the order of the arguments when you enter them. 
</p>
<p>	
	There's one other thing you can do with <code>#zip</code>, which is pass it a block. The block will do something to the output arrays:
</p>
<code class="code-block">things = ["cat", "dog", "grandma"]</code>
<code class="code-block">affection_level = [5, 11, 9]</code>
<code class="code-block">things.zip(affection_level) { |array| print "#{array[1]} " }</code>
<code class="code-block">=> "5 11 9"</code>
<p>	
	Now, if I'm to be completely honest here, I'm actually having a hard time imagining a situation where <code>#zip</code> would come in handy. It seems like if you wanted to access data from multiple arrays, you could just loop through them and reference the same index in each to accomplish the same effect. If you can think of a good application for this method, I would love to hear your idea!
