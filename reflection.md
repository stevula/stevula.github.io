#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
There's a trick with margins to horizontally center block elements:
  margin: 0 auto;

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?
CSS positioning is wonky and unintuitive.

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement?
nav bars, text formatting, and background colors are very easy.

#What was most difficult?
Positioning! Especially vertical positioning, which makes me want to cry.

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
There seems to be a lot of disagreement in the web design community about the best way to lay out CSS code. I read a lot about atomic CSS, BEM, and OOCSS and there doesn't seem to be any consensus.
